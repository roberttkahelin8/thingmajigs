Things to remember and look out for:
- This is not to be used for a bug report. Crashes are very serious things and require more attention than just bugs alone.
- This mod may not support all mod loaders. You will know if it doesn't if the game crashes and a mod loader says that a certain file is not for it's loader in a crash log.
- Upload crash logs to PasteBin so they don't clutter the issue reports page. You can set them to disappear in a week, or longer time, instead of permanently up and public.
